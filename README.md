DCC Dongle
===========

DCC signal generator controled by computer.

In this project, Arduino listen on serial port for commands and generate DCC signal.

This project is based on CmdrArduino library from Railstars for generate DCC signal. 
It's necessary to install it on Arduino environment.
See :  https://github.com/Railstars/CmdrArduino or http://railstars.com/software/cmdrarduino/


An interface is available for this arduino firmware on this repository : https://github.com/nmeunier/SocialTrainController

Note
----

Arduino output are not capable of driving train directly. Use a booster for amplifying DCC signal.
